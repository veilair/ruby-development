title: Forgiving ruby
content: |-
  sometimes when you write in ruby fast enough you may miss some character, maybe miss write a character or something, i thought that there is a way we can make ruby more forgiving toward your writing mistakes
  it is easy we'll monkey patch the Object class to respond to methods that doesn't exists but there is another method that is quite like it.

this script is soooo awesome

it will convert any ruby script to image, and any other script (you can change language name to make it suitable for python, css, html for instance),

code depend on 2 gems (pygmentize and selenium), first it read code and highlight it using Pygmentize
then insert the output to a webpage with CSS style to color the tokens.

next save the whole HTML page to disk and use Selenium to open it using Filefox (so make sure you have it installed on your machine)

it saves the page as image to your disk then closes the browser and delete the HTML page (some housekeeping)
aaaand Tadaaaa you have your code highlighted as an image.

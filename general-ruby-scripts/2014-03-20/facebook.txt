Facebook group hall of fame script

if you're a facebook group admin, and you faced a tiny problem
of "who are the active members in my group?" and want to make
analytics about it, here is the magical way.

this script will find the target group by its name and get the
latest posts pages till it reach a certain limit or exceed it
then will merge the posts in the form of (user -> count of posts)
then sort them descending and show you the group Hall of fame

i usedkoala gem (it is very simple and i used it before alot), 
psych gem to to_yaml, if you prefer you can save it as json or
any other format, have fun playing with it.

PS: BTW, this song is a little inspiring when you're running the script :D

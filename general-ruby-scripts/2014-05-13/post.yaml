title: Printing twitter and github followers
content: |-
  this script could be part of large script of monitoring your followers number across social media, and sum them to form a social score of some kind just like klout does.
  as i didn't find an apropriate api to get these data as guest i had to scrap the data from html pages using regex.
  if there are other social media that we can add to this script i'll be more than happy if you forked this script and modified.

title: Scrap UK top 40 singles chart from BBC
content: |-
  this is small but useful script, it could be used as a plugin for sublimeText, CMS, news website to get the top 40 UK singles from BBC website.
  script gets teh printable format of the chart and extract data then form them as array of Hash maps easy to iterate on and filter
  the original full chart is here : http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles and they got a printable format page here : http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles/print so it was easier for us to scrap the printable version.
  have fun using it.

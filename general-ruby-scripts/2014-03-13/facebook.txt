Monitor directories sizes and take an action if one of them exceeded

this is a simple script for system administrators to monitor directories sizes
and report to them if one of them exceeded the allocated size.

the problem arise if you're responsible of a system and wanted to monitor small websites
sizes without blocking their expansion, so you'll have to create a deamon application that
alert you when one of them exceeds the size expected.

this script will do so, it'll iterate on a set of directories and check their size
and alert you if one of them exceeded their size, and will wait for one hour then try again

you can change the waiting period and directories set and sizes expected in bytes.

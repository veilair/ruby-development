Download all messages between you and a friend from facebook

that was a little hard, getting all messages between you and a friend
require that you know the thread ID, so i had to grab all your latest messages
from inbox and prompt the user to choose one of them and tell me the ID

next i faced a weired problem : Facebook Graph documentation is outdated and 
each time i get a request i can' access information the right way, so i had
to inspect and use IRB step by step to get it done.

the third problem was that facebook treat messages as posts, so the first time
you send a message to a friend is a post and all the other messages are comments
T_T that made me cry, after getting all comments i had to get the original message
in a separate request.

that was a harder script than i thought, but here we are, finished and ready for 
you to have fun with ;)

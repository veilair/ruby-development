get facebook friends data and save them as json file

first get require koala library for facebook interaction
get an access token with "user_friends" permission for any application you have
then use the script, it should get all facebook friends pages and collect all
of them into an array and save them to a file as json format,
also you can import 'psych' and save them as YAML file using
to_yaml instead of to_json ;) that was easy huh?

title: Convert Ruby scripts to HTML and Markdown
content: "first i have to say that my scripts will be a little longer\nthan ever,
  to be more verbose and less encrypted, so images \nassociated with my posts will
  be cropped and linked to\nfull post on Github, post will contain an HTML version
  \nand code file.\nthis script will read ruby code and parse it and split it to\nset
  of blocks (code blocks, comments blocks) and then output\nHTML format or Markdown
  Format, make sure your comments are written\nin Markdown format.\ni combine this
  script with an older one that convert HTML page to PNG image\nand then i use Cairo
  library to crop it and write the post title, \nyou can use it to generate beautiful
  code documentation with a bit of\nenhancement (index page and links back in each
  page maybe)."

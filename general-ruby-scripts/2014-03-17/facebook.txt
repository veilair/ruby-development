Create a Waving ColorSpace using ruby

this screen consist of equal squares, each one has a color
in the format (Hue, Saturation, Value), and a color velocity+direction
each time we want to wave the color, we'll add the color velocity
to the color components respectively, and if the color reached 
the component limit e.g(0<Hue<360) the Color will reset to the limit.
that was easy, script is flexible so you can enlarge screen dimension
to get a bigger dream :), and you can play with squares numeber for higher
resolution or lower one.

Have fun playing with it, also if you have any great idea for tomorrow's script
send me a message, or put it in a comment here.

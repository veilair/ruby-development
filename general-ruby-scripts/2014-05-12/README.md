autochanging wallpaper from reddit images
you have to point the script to your existing
file you set it as a wallpaper and it will override
it with a new image every 5 minutes.

this script works on centos 6 with GNOME/GTK2 interface
```ruby
require 'open-uri' # we'll need to download image with that
require 'ruby_reddit_api' # gem install ruby_reddit_api

```
class will be initialized with
a subreddit to monitor and a
destination file to write the
downloaded image to it
```ruby
class RedditWallpaper

  def initialize( subreddit, destination_file = 'bg.jpg' )
    @subreddit = subreddit
    @path = destination_file
    @downloaded = []
    @not_downloaded = []
  end

```
download the url to destination
```ruby
  def download( url )
    image = open( "#{url}.jpg" ).read
    File.write  @path, image
  end

```
update wallpaper and update images cache
```ruby
  def update
```
make me a reddit client please
```ruby
    r = Reddit::Api.new

```
update earth
```ruby
    posts = r.browse @subreddit
    posts.each do |r|
      @not_downloaded << r.url if r.url.include?('imgur') and !@downloaded.include?(r.url)
    end

    image = @not_downloaded.shift
    download image

  end

end

```
i'll get images from earthporn
they have lots of great images of
nature places
and then i'll update it every 5 minutes
```ruby
downloader = RedditWallpaper.new 'earthPorn', '/home/eelsaid/Pictures/bg.jpg'
loop do
  downloader.update
  sleep 5*60 # wait for 5 minutes
end

```

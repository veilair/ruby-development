Get your twitter Now playing stream

this sould me a good start for a tiwtter music player the idea is suggested by @EyeWriteCode on twitter, it is easy, we want to know what my friends are listening to, the tweets should be marked by one of the now playing hashtags (#NP,#NW, #nowplaying..etc).

so far this is pretty easy, get tweets and filter them with hashtag, but lets leverage it abit more, how about cleaning the tweet a little bit ? lets remove all mentions and hashtags and consecutive spaces and new lines to make it more readable.

this could be enhanced even more by separating links into the end of the tweet, of cleaning the tweet even more from dashes and all the unnecessary stuff.
